## My Thoughts
I wanted a way to manage my college tasks I had to do because the list usually got out of hand. I needed a way to write them down and keep them handy without having to plaster my wall with post-it notes, which is why I thought about making this program.

I haven't learned how to create a GUI in python yet, so i might redo this project in the future after i learn how to create a GUI in python.
